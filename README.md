# MEILER
MEI Lilypond Engraving Refinement

mei2ly.xsl supports already many music elements from MEI and works for checking encoding errors.
Basic layout features are implemented for global staff size and page layout.

For now it uses XSLT 2.0. Goal for a later branch is to have an pure XSLT 1.0 version to put on a website, where you can generate a lilypond engraved rendering of a MEI edition on the fly.
